## XConf DataService Overview

Xconf is slated to be the single entity for managing firmware on set-top boxes both in the field
and in various warehouses and test environments.

Xconf's primary purpose is to tell set-top boxes (STBs) what version of firmware they should be running. 
Xconf does not push firmware to the STB, nor is not involved in any way in the actual download / upgrade process. 
It simply tells the STB which version to use. Xconf also tells STBs when, where (host), and how (protocol) to get the firmware.

Xconf DataService is the app that the STBs talk to. Xconf Admin allows humans to enter all the information necessary for Xconf to provide the correct information to STBs.

The interface between STBs and Xconf is simple. STBs make HTTP requests to Xconf sending information like MAC address, environment, and model. Xconf then applies various rules to determine which firmware information to return. The information is returned in JSON format.

## Architecture

* Golang
* gorilla/mux
* Cassandra DB

## Run the application
1. Run cassandra DB and create a corresponding schema using `db_init.cql` file in `db` folder.
2. Use config/sample_xconfwebconfig.conf to add/override specific environments properties.
4. Build the binary:
```shell
cd .../xconfwebconfig
make
```
5. Run the application:
```shell
export SAT_CLIENT_ID='xxxxxx'
export SAT_CLIENT_SECRET='yyyyyy'
export SECURITY_TOKEN_KEY='zzzzzz'
mkdir -p /app/logs/xconfwebconfig
cd .../xconfwebconfig
bin/xconfwebconfig-linux-amd64 -f config/sample_xconfwebconfig.conf
```

## Endpoints

### XConf Primary API

| PATH | METHOD | MAIN QUERY PARAMETERS | DESCRIPTION |
|------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `/xconf/swu/{applicationType}` | `GET` |`eStbMac`,<br>`ipAddress`,<br>`env`,<br>`model`,<br>`firmwareVersion`,<br>`partnerId`,<br>`accountId`,<br>`{tag name}` - any tag from Tagging Service,<br>`controllerId`,<br>`channelMapId`,<br>`vodId`| Returns firmwareVersion to STB box <br> `{applicationType}` - for now supported `stb`, `xhome`, `rdkcloud` |
| `/xconf/swu/bse` | `GET` | `ipAddress` - required | Returns BSE configuration |
| `/xconf/{applicationType}/runningFirmwareVersion/info` | `GET` | `mac` - required | Return if device has Activation Minimum Firmware and Minimum Firmware version |
| `/estbfirmware/checkMinimumFirmware` | `GET` | `mac` - required | Return if device has Minimum Firmware version |

#### Headers 
For `/xconf/swu/{applictionType}` API: <br>
`HA-Haproxy-xconf-http` to indicate if connection is secure

### Device Configuration Manager (DCM)

Remote devices like set top boxes and DVRs have settings to control certain activities. For instance, STBs need to know when to upload log files, or when to check for a new firmware update. In order to remotely manage a large population of devices, we need a solution that lets support staff define instructions and get the instructions to the devices.

| PATH | METHOD | MAIN QUERY PARAMETERS | DESCRIPTION |
|------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `/loguploader/getSettings/{applicationType}` | `GET` | `estbMacAddress`,<br>`ipAddress`,<br>`env`,<br>`model`,<br>`firmwareVersion`,<br>`partnerId`,<br>`accountId`,<br>`{tag name}` - any tag from Tagging Service,<br>`checkNow` - boolean,<br>`version`,<br>`settingsType`,<br>`ecmMacAddress`,<br>`controllerId`,<br>`channelMapId`,<br>`vodId` | Returns settings to STB box <br> `{applicationType}` - for now supported `stb`, `xhome`, `rdkcloud`, <br>field is optional and `stb` application is used by default |
| `/loguploader/getT2Settings/{applicationType}` | `GET` | The same as a previous | Returns telemetry configuration in the new format. If the component name has been defined for an entry, <br>the response will be in the new format. The second and third columns for that entry will not be used in the response. <br>The content field comes from the fifth column (component name). The type field will be a constant string `<event>` |
| `/loguploader/getTelemetryProfiles/{applicationType}` | `GET` | The same as a previous | Returns Telemetry 2.0 profiles based on Telemetry 2.0 rules |

### Rule Structure
There are 6 different rule types: FirmwareRule, DCM Rule (Formula), TelemetryRule, TelemetryTwoRule, SettingRule and FeatureRule (RFC Rule).

Extended from `Rule` object: `DCM Rule`, `TelemetryRule`, `TelemetryTwoRule`. It means that rule object itself has rule structure, corresponding rule fields like `negated`, `condition`, `compoundParts` and `relation` are located in root json object itself.

Otherwise there is rule field.

`TelemetryRule` json extended by `Rule` object:

```json
{
    "negated": false,
    "compoundParts": [
    {
        "negated": false,
        "condition":
        {
            "freeArg":
            {
                "type": "STRING",
                "name": "model"
            },
            "operation": "IS",
            "fixedArg":
            {
                "bean":
                {
                    "value":
                    {
                        "java.lang.String": "TEST_MODEL1"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "compoundParts": []
    },
    {
        "negated": false,
        "relation": "OR",
        "condition":
        {
            "freeArg":
            {
                "type": "STRING",
                "name": "model"
            },
            "operation": "IS",
            "fixedArg":
            {
                "bean":
                {

                        "java.lang.String": "TEST_MODEL2"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "compoundParts": []
    }],
    "boundTelemetryId": "ad10dd05-d2ff-4d00-8f52-b0ca6956cde6",
    "id": "fb4210ac-8187-4cba-9301-eb8f27fcdaa8",
    "name": "Arris_SVG",
    "applicationType": "stb"
}
```


`FeatureRule` json, which contains `Rule` object
```json
{
    "id": "018bfb79-4aaf-426e-9e45-17e26d52ad49",
    "name": "Test",
    "rule":
    {
        "negated": false,
        "condition":
        {
            "freeArg":
            {
                "type": "STRING",
                "name": "estbMacAddress"
            },
            "operation": "IS",
            "fixedArg":
            {
                "bean":
                {
                    "value":
                    {
                        "java.lang.String": "AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "compoundParts": []
    },
    "priority": 13,
    "featureIds": ["68add112-cdc9-47be-ae3b-86e753c8d23e"],
    "applicationType": "stb"
}
```

#### Rule Object
There are following fields there:<br>
`negated` - means condition is with `not` operand.<br>
`condition` - key and value statement.<br>
`compoundParts` - list with multiple conditions.<br>
`relation` - operation between multiple conditions, possible values `OR`, `AND`.

#### Condition structure
Each condition has `freeArg` and `fixedArg` field.
freeArg typed key.
fixedArg value meaning.

If rule has only one condition there are no `compoundParts`, `relation` field is empty.
If there are more than one condition - they are located in `compoundParts` object. First condition does not have any relation, next one has a relation.

## Core Idea and Project Overview

**xconfwebconfig** is a microservice designed to manage and deliver configuration and firmware information to remote devices (primarily set-top boxes, or STBs) in the field, warehouses, and test environments.

### Key Concepts

- **Centralized Configuration Management**:  
xconfwebconfig acts as the authoritative source for device firmware versions, feature flags, and operational settings. It does not push firmware, but tells devices what version to use and where to get it.

- **Rule-Based Decision Engine**:  
The service uses a flexible rule engine to determine which configuration or firmware a device should receive, based on device attributes (MAC, model, environment, etc.).

- **RESTful API**:  
Devices interact with xconfwebconfig via HTTP endpoints, sending identifying information and receiving JSON responses with configuration details.

- **Extensible for Multiple Application Types**:  
While primarily used for STBs, the architecture supports other device types (e.g., xhome, rdkcloud) via the `{applicationType}` parameter.

- **Separation of Concerns**:  
The codebase is organized to separate API handling, business logic, and data persistence, making it maintainable and extensible.

### Typical Use Cases

- **Firmware Management**:  
Devices query which firmware version to use, and xconfwebconfig responds based on current rules and device attributes.

- **Settings Distribution**:  
Devices fetch operational settings (e.g., log upload schedules, telemetry profiles) tailored to their environment and model.

- **Feature Control**:  
Feature flags can be enabled/disabled remotely for specific devices or groups, allowing for controlled rollouts and testing.

---

## Community & Contribution

- **Extensible Design**:  
The modular structure allows contributors to add new endpoints, rule types, or support for additional device types with minimal friction.

- **Open for Collaboration**:  
Contributions are welcome! Please follow the existing code organization and submit pull requests with clear descriptions.
